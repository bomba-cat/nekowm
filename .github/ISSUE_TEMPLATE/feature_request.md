## Summary

Describe the feature you want to see in NekoWM. Keep it technical and precise.

## Motivation

Why do you want this feature? What problem does it solve, or what functionality does it enable?

## Proposed Implementation

(Optional but appreciated)

How would this be implemented in NekoWM? Include any technical insight, pseudocode, or references to similar tiling behavior in other WMs if relevant.

## Alternatives

Have you considered alternative approaches? Is there a reason this should be part of the WM rather than handled externally? (Example: Transparency via Picom)

## Checklist

- [ ] I’ve verified this is not already requested
- [ ] I’ve checked if it fits the scope/philosophy of NekoWM (minimal, no configs, standalone)
- [ ] I’m willing to help implement this
